# Satisfy
I love this project so much! I consider this as my most complex project that I've made since I started to learn programming (around September 2017). This project was my attempt to learn php(since before I made some project using asp.net mvc) and I really liked how well php combines with the front-end part of the web application.
A short description for Satisfy it would be that is a copy of Spotify but used in browser.
